Google Apps Script for Plain Text Lists

This Google Apps Script converts a numbered list in your active Google Doc to a plain text list with indentation to represent the hierarchy.
Functionality

This script currently only processes the first encountered numbered list in the document. Any subsequent numbered lists in the document will be ignored and left unchanged.

The script iterates through the elements of your document and identifies numbered list items. It then:

    Creates a counter object to track the numbering for each level of nesting.
    Builds a prefix for each list item based on its nesting level.
    Inserts the prefix before the list item text.
    Applies bold formatting to the prefix.
    (Optional) Removes the list markers (bullets or numbers).
    Increments the counter for the current nesting level.
    Resets counters for deeper nesting levels.

Usage

    Copy the script code and paste it into your Google Apps Script project.
    Run the function convertNumberedListToPlainText().

Important Note: This script modifies the active document. Make sure to back up your document before running the script.
